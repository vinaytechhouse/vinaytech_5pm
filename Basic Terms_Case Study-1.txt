Important words:
Preview: May change or removed in future
Lanscape: Web/Desktop view
Portrait: Mobile view
Power BI: In documentation refers to Power BI Service


Dataset: Set of queries,lists, parameters etc. [ we will find in Data Pane]
Query: Set of columns [typically a table]
Column: Field: Attribute

Drill Through: One page to another page navigation is called as dril through.
-----------------------------------------
Data Display Visuals: [view the data]
------------------------------------------
Card Visual: Takes single value [an aggregated value or an expression result value]
Table Visual: Multiple columns it will display [columnar visual], header and footer available. No drill-down and drill-up.
Matrix Visual: Cross tab visual [rows vs. columns], row and column totals possible. Supports drill-down and drill-up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Graphical Visual: [compare, composite, distribute, relationship, trend analysis etc.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pie Chart: Composition of all categories to 100% and used for less catagories contribution towards 100% and comparing.
Line Chart: Categories [or a category] trend over period of time graphical display.
Map: Geographical presentation of values [locations and values ]


================================================================================
Practical:
=================================================================================
1. Open Power BI Desktop, Get Data--> Excel Workbook->Browse to excel
2. Goto Data View[grid view] and verify queries information [proper structure and data elements]
   Note: A few queries column headings are not proper, so we need to go to Transformation Area
3.  Data Changes implementation [Transformation]

 Home menu--> Transform data
   Note: It goes to Power Query Editor [which is an Extract and Transform Area and contain hundreds of transformation options]
   Go o query which is not having proper column headings-> specify  "First row asheader"
    Home menu-->Close and apply
4. Go to the case study and identify the number of tables used in this case study, establish relationships

	Goto Model View--> COnnect dimensions to fact in either of the ways
	1st way:
		Drag and drop column from one to another
	2nd way: Table name->right click->Manage relationships

	DimStudent->Factpayments
	Dimdate->Factpayments
	Dimlocation-->Factpayments
5. More modeling is recommended [calculation values, calculation columns, calculation tables]
	Note: A few operations we can do graphically, but if you want to implement all operations you need
		DAX language [Data Analysis Expression Language]
		
		DAX: Data Analysis Expressions
		What it is? A functional or furmula language [around 300 formulas like excel formulas]
		Why?	"Modeling (relationships)" and "Analytics(aggregate, analytical operations)"
			Aggregates: Sum, Avg, Max, Min, Count etc.
			Analytics: Rank, Top, Bottom etc.
